# News Classifier 

Weatherpredict is a machine learning project whose goal is to classify newspaper articles into five different categories. 

The project is split into three main parts. 

## Web Scraping

We use BeautifulSoup to extract news articles from *La Presse* and *Le Journal de Montreal*. We extracted the articles from the archives and from the most recent news of the day. 

The datas are contained in the folder Data and the web scraping is performed in the files in the Web Scraping folder. 

## Data Cleaning and Data Analysis (*Ongoing*)

We clean, analyze and prepare the datas for features engineering using text representation methods. 

This is done in the folder ***Data Cleaning***. 

## Machine Learning Model (*To do*)

We test several models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) and tune hyperparameters.
